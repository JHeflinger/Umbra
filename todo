serialize window width and height and settings like imgui does
profiler on per shader
all shaders can get certain data 
- such as time

debug features!

make explorere refresh every ~1 second?

warn when a scene object wil not be rendered bc there isn't a shader stage for it


next up:
- default scene / load .slumbra file
- edit file feature
- profiler
- hot reloading for everything
- debugger
